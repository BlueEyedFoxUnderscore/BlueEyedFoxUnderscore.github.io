            <div class="stbody">&emsp;Writing is a test of one's character and resolve; to write a work is to draft a new world into existence, and doing so takes strength and endurance. One must fill in everything from the broadest strokes to the finest details, from the most widespread tradition to the most intimate detail of a character's life. To do so properly requries devotion, perhaps even love.
                <br><br>&emsp;All of that is probably why I haven't been able to finish a single book, despite all of them having great openings. I currently have three books that I might finish, and each of them has a different topic it covers. I am working on <em>The Memoirs of a Creator Deity: How to Be a God (Responsibly)</em>, <em>The Paradigm-Anomaly</em> (a story about how a single change led the entire world to live differently), and <em>Greybox</em> (a story about hubris and how it can kill entire worlds, or perhaps even doom a universe).
